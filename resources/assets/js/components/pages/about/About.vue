                <h4>How can I contribute?</h4>
                <p>
                    In RIT Nap Spot Map everyone can be a Naps guru! To contribute, click in Add an Entry, select a place were you regularly Nap on campus, fill in the extra information and add it to the map.
                    <br />
                    Once you add a Nap Spot, you will see it represented by a brown marker, this means that your spot is waiting to be reviewed by one of our moderators and will only be visible to you.
